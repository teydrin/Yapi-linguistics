Is Min Really a descendant of Old chinese? 
                              Yapi Linguistics

It is common among major linguists, to think of the Min languages,spoken in fujian,as descendants of old chinese due to some earliest 
colloiqual readings underivable from midde chinese. Let's examine the earliest colliqual readings in hokkien (a southern min language)

As you can see,the earliest hokkien readings underivable from middle chinese aren't derivable from old chinese as well.
Therfore i belive that Min is actually a product of very Early middle chinese that inherited significant non-sinitic readings.
