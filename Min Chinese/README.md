Is Min Really a descendant of Old chinese? 
                              Yapi Linguistics

It is common among major linguists, to think of the Min languages,spoken in fujian,as descendants of old chinese due to some earliest 
colloiqual readings underivable from midde chinese. Let's examine the earliest colliqual readings in hokkien (a southern min language)

| Middle Chinese | Hokkien (earliest) | Old Chinese | Result                          |

| tsywijX        | tsui               | [s]tur      | Direct descendant of MC          |


As you can see,the earliest hokkien readings underivable from middle chinese aren't derivable from old chinese as well.
Therfore i belive that Min is actually a product of very Early middle chinese that inherited significant non-sinitic readings.

Let's examine the finals of hokkien and compare them with that of cantonese:

This is likley not a coincidence due to chance. At best it's external influence but sheer external influence likley shouldn't 
result to such a similarity,as we see below:


the syntax that hokkien and hakka both share but old chinese doesn't have:

1.SVO word order (flexible in old chinese)
2.Sentence/Final praticles (none in old chinese)
3."的" procession marker (nonexistant in old chinese)
4.Resultative verb compounds (not much yet in old chinese)

One may still argue that the Min languages evolved those features that fit other sinitic languages in coincidence, but let's 
examine lhasa tibetan instead

Lhasa tibetan has SOV word order
Lhasa tibetan has no sentence/Final praticles
Lhasa tibetan has  no "的" marker
Lhasa tibetan's verb compounds are not as prelavant as modern chinese languages

IF all those middle chinese agined features were simply independently developed,or are results of pure borrowings, it shouldn't 
be present in ALL min variants,as some variants (hokkien,which had the biggest port in the world in the 11th century) have 
much more exposure to mainstream sinitic than variants like eastern min,and "adoption" would be very uneven.

Therfore i firmly belive that the Min variants are descendants of Six dynasties (3rd-6th century) chinese that recived massive 
austroasiatic influence.
