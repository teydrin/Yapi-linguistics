Is Min Really a descendant of Old chinese? 
                              Yapi Linguistics

It is common among major linguists, to think of the Min languages,spoken in fujian,as descendants of old chinese due to some earliest 
colloiqual readings underivable from midde chinese. Let's examine the earliest colliqual readings in hokkien (a southern min language)

| Middle Chinese | Hokkien (earliest) | Old Chinese | Result                          |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| phwung         | hong  (風)            | pron        | Direct descendant of MC          |
| srann          | sann （三）              | sram        | Direct descendant of MC          |
| yu             | ho   （雨）              | lu or gwa   | Leans MC, but possibly not a descendant |
| kaew           | kau  （狗）              | kˤuʔ        | Direct descendant of MC          |
| mjun           | mui/mng （門）               | mə[n]       | Leans MC,     |
| xwae           | hue （花）               | qʷʰˤra      | Direct descendant of MC          |
| djrang         | sng （床）               | lron        | Underivable from both OC and MC  |
| khanH          | kuann  （看）            | khan-s      | Direct descendant of MC          |
| dai            | toa  （大）              | lˤat-s      | d→t, ai→oa → Descendant of MC    |
| sjejH          | seh   （細）             | set-s       | Direct descendant of MC          |
| nywuk          | bah （肉）               | nuk         | Underivable from both            |
| xwaH           | hue  （火）              | pʰˤraʔ      | Direct descendant of MC          |
| tsywijX        | tsui  （水）             | [s]tur      | Direct descendant of MC          |


As you can see,the earliest hokkien readings underivable from middle chinese aren't derivable from old chinese as well.
Therfore i belive that Min is actually a product of very Early middle chinese that inherited significant non-sinitic readings(heavy ancient min substrate, thicker than other sinitic languages).

Let's examine the finals of hokkien and compare them with that of cantonese:

This is likley not a coincidence due to chance. At best it's external influence but sheer external influence likley shouldn't 
result to such a similarity,as we see below:


the syntax that hokkien and hakka both share but old chinese and Lhasa tibetan doesn't have:


| Feature                         | Old Chinese                      | Hokkien,hockchew and Hakka                  | Lhasa Tibetan |
| ------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1. Word Order                   | Flexible (SOV \~ SVO)            | SVO                                     | SOV     |                                      |
| 2. Sentence-final particles     | Absent                           | Present (e.g., ah, la, le, ma)          | Absent  |                                     |
| 3. Possessive marker ("的"-type) | Absent (used 之 or juxtaposition) | Present (的 in Mandarin, ê in Hokkien)   | absent    |
| 4. Resultative verb compounds   | Rare or emerging                 | Fully developed (e.g., 寫好, 吃完)          |Limited   |

IF all those middle chinese agined features were simply independently developed(debunked by lhasa tibetan),or are results of pure borrowings, they shouldn't be present in ALL min variants,as some variants (hokkien,which had the biggest port in the world in the 11th century) have 
much more exposure to mainstream sinitic than variants like eastern min,and "adoption" would be very uneven.

What we are seeing is, that these traits apply to basically all Min variants.All Min variants fit the 4 features i listed. aswell as the stops,nasal, vowels and vocabulary.
(Leizhou,yognan,puxian and hockchew all fit it despite having a more complex tone sandhi)

Therfore i firmly belive that the Min variants are descendants of Six dynasties (3rd-5th century) pre qieyun chinese that recived austroasiatic influence(Or perhaps just had a heavy Min substrate) instead of that of old chinese.
